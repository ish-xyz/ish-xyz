I'm an engineer appasionated about the whole "cloud-native world".
Cloud architectures design, automation tools programming, container orchestration, observability, and SRE practices are activities that have drawn much of my focus.

Through my personal blog and my GitHub account I aim to share the knowledge I'm gaining day to day, working on different major companies such as Just Eat, eBay, QBE and so on.
